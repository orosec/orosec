- 👋 Hi, I’m @orosec
- 👀 I’m interested in storing third party source code (CMS for example) which I want to customize for my needs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning no particular language, I am not a developer, I am more on the requirement engineering side of things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I can contribute on translating strings displayed by a GUI in French but not code (see supra)
- 📫 How to reach me ... via this GitHub account I suppose ?
